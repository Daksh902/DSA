Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to return the answer.
Do this recursively.
Input format :
Two integers x and n (separated by space)
Output Format :
x^n (i.e. x raise to the power n)
Constraints :
0 <= x <= 30
0 <= n <= 30



public class Solution {

	public static int power(int x, int n) {
		if(n == 0)
		return 1;

		if(x == 0)
		return 0;

		return x*power(x,n-1) ;
	
		
	}
}
