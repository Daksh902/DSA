/*
You allowed to open a single tab in the browser. All the activities have to be done on that particular tab. You will start with the given homepage. You can visit a particular url. You can get back x steps in history and get forward x steps in the history.
Implement the BrowserHistory class:
1. BrowserHistory(string homepage): Initializes the object with the homepage of the browser. 
2. void visit(string url): Visits url from the current page. It clears up all the forward history.
3. string back(int steps): Move steps back in history. If you can only return x steps in the history and steps > x, you will return only x steps. Return the current url, after moving back in history.
4. string forward(int steps): Move steps forward in history. If you can only forward x steps in the history and steps > x, you will forward only x steps. Return the current url after forwarding in history.
Input Format:
There is only one line of input. The first word in the input denotes the homepage. The following line of input contain function calls made using following choices:
1. If the choice is 1, then visit function is called. First the choice and then a string is given to us as input, which is passed as an input url to visit function.
2. If the choice is 2, then back function is called. First the choice and then a integer is given to us as input, which is passed as an input integer to back function.
3. If the choice is 3, then forward function is called. First the choice and then a integer is given to us as input, which is passed as an input integer to forward function.
Output format:
For each call, made to back or forward function, we have to print the url, which will be opened after moving back or forward in history. Each url needs to be printed on a newline
