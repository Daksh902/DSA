/*
Given the head of a singly linked list of integers, find and return its length.

Example:
Sample Linked List

The length of the list is 4. Hence we return 4.

Note:
Exercise caution when dealing with edge cases, such as when the head is NULL. Failing to handle these edge cases appropriately may result in a runtime error in your code.


Input format :
The first and only line contains elements of the singly linked list separated by a single space, -1 indicates the end of the singly linked list and hence, would never be a list element.


Output format :
Return a single integer denoting the length of the linked list.
