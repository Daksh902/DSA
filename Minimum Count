/*
Given an integer N, find and return the count of minimum numbers, sum of whose squares is equal to N.
That is, if N is 4, then we can represent it as : {1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2} and {2^2}. Output will be 1, as 1 is the minimum count of numbers required.
Note : x^y represents x raise to the power y.
Input Format :
Integer N
Output Format :
Required minimum count
Constraints :
1 <= N <= 50
