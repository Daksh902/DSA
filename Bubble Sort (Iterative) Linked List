/*
Given a singly linked list of integers, sort it using 'Bubble Sort.'
Note :
No need to print the list, it has already been taken care. Only return the new head to the list.
Input format :
The first and the only line of each test case or query contains the elements of the singly linked list separated by a single space.
Remember/Consider :
While specifying the list elements for input, -1 indicates the end of the singly linked list and hence, would never be a list element
Output format :
For each test case/query, print the elements of the sorted singly linked list.

Output for every test case will be printed in a seperate line.
Constraints :
0 <= M <= 10^3
Where M is the size of the singly linked list.

Time Limit: 1sec
